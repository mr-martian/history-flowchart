This folder contains all data regarding events in the various histories.
A few things to take note of:
 - Each universe folder (UF) contains a doc.txt, please read it. It specifies:
   - Levels
   - File structure
 - Each UF also contains a settings.lisp file, which specifies:
   - Date arithmatic
   - Propper conversion from in-world locations to cartiesian coordinates (-> 1D handled elsewhere)
