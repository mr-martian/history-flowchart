history-flowchart
=================
This program is intended to create flowcharts of history in the hope that this may help in searching for patterns that may help in predicting the future. If this plan fails, we'll still get some cool graphs.

It also has the capability to make graphs for other (fictional) universes.

Remember to read all doc.md files before proceeding (in case this wasn't obvious).

Data is events and effects, Code is the program.
Check doc.md for a folder's todo list.
